# Pomodorino
Pomodorino is a Pomodoro timer that stresses simplicity and functionality. The timer is based off of [the Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) which was created by Francesco Cirillo. Its name comes from the Italian word for small tomato, as it is a light-weight version of the installable variations that circulate the web today.

If you would like to [use Pomodorino](http://cosmicauma31.github.io/Pomodorino/), the application is hosted on a GitHub page.

## About the Pomodoro Technique
This productivity technique breaks up daunting work into easy 25 minute chunks called a "pomodoro." After each session of work, the user gets a short 3-5 minute break. For every four pomodori, the user is rewarded with a longer 10-15 minute break.

In this light-weight flavor of the timer, a pomodoro will be refered to as a pomodorino. Additionally, the plural form of the word is "pomodorini."

## Current Development Goals:
Changes are being pushed to the gh-pages branch for testing. Version 2 will be released promptly.

- HTML
- CSS
